# Weather-Station-Prototype
A cloud and micro controller based project that detects gas levels and climate changes

#Environment: C, C++, Thingspeak cloud platform, IoT infrastructure.

Organization: Fleming College • October 2021 -August 2022

Our sponsor was concerned about the proliferation in the number of pollutants released from trucks near food processors company. The sponsor desired to design a model which can provide him with an exact amount of gas level and overall climatic changes taking place and how it affects the flora and fauna nearby. Furthermore, to send the data onto the sponsor's mobile. We design the station that gathers the data and uploads the data onto the cloud. Where BME 680, RJ-11, and Davis Anemometer sensors are used to detect analog values. The ESP32 module is used to transfer real-time data gathered from sensors and upload it onto the cloud platform “ThingSpeak”.  To provide feasibility, we modeled the station to be portable, I have incorporated the solar panel along with a backup model to drive the station by utilizing the use of an MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) charge.



Component used: BME 680, ESP32, RJ-11, Davis Anemometer, MPPT, Solar panel.
